	<h1>Memory Game Instructions</h1>
	<p>You will be shown a board of cards, each with a symbol on their back.</p>
	<p>On each turn, you will click on two cards to flip them over and reveal their
		symbol.
	</p>
	<p>If the symbols match, the cards will stay flipped, and you will continue
		your turn.
	</p>
	<p>If the symbols do not match, the cards will turn back over, and you will be
		given a new turn.
	</p>
	<p>The game is over when you match all of the cards.</p>
	<p>Try to match them in the fewest turns possible!</p>
